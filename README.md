# Time-Series-Forecasting-Analysis

Description: This project focuses on forecasting daily bike rental demand using time series analysis. The dataset used for this analysis contains daily and hourly records of bike rentals in Washington, D.C., from the Capital Bikeshare system between 2011 and 2012. The goal of the project is to build a predictive model to improve demand forecasting accuracy, which in turn will help optimize fleet management and pricing strategies for the bike rental company. 

Key Steps and Analysis: Data Exploration and Cleaning: The dataset was thoroughly explored to understand trends and patterns in bike rentals. This step involved handling missing data, transforming date columns into the appropriate format, and generating new features such as day of the week and hour of the day. 

Time Series Decomposition: The daily bike rental data was decomposed into its trend, seasonal, and residual components to better understand underlying patterns. This decomposition provided insights into seasonality effects and long-term trends in bike rentals. 

ARIMA Modeling: An ARIMA model was fitted to the time series data to forecast future bike rental demand. The auto.arima function from the forecast package was used to automatically select the best model based on AIC values. 

Model Diagnostics: The residuals of the ARIMA model were analyzed to check for any remaining patterns or correlations. The diagnostics indicated that the model fits the data well, with residuals behaving as white noise. 

Forecasting Results: The model was used to forecast bike rental demand for the next 30 days. These forecasts can be used to guide business decisions such as fleet distribution and dynamic pricing. 

Conclusion: The time series analysis and ARIMA modeling provided valuable insights into bike rental patterns, enabling better decision-making for the bike rental company. 

The forecasts generated by the model are expected to help optimize operational efficiency and improve profitability. The full analysis, including code and results, is published in this report. 

Insights 1. Residuals vs Fitted Values Plot (Top Left) 

Observation: The residuals appear to be centered around zero, with no obvious pattern or trend. Insight: This suggests that the ARIMA model has done a reasonable job of capturing the underlying patterns in the data, leaving no significant structure in the residuals. However, there is some variability in the residuals, particularly towards the right side of the plot, which could indicate periods of under- or over-prediction. 

2. ACF of Residuals (Bottom Left) Observation: The ACF plot shows autocorrelations of the residuals at different lags. Most of the autocorrelation values are within the blue dashed lines, which represent the confidence intervals. Insight: The fact that the autocorrelations are mostly within the confidence intervals suggests that the residuals are largely uncorrelated. This is a good sign, as it indicates that the model has accounted for most of the temporal structure in the data. However, there are a few lags where the autocorrelation is slightly outside the confidence intervals, which could suggest some remaining correlation that the model hasn't fully captured. 

3. Histogram of Residuals (Bottom Right) Observation: The histogram of residuals is centered around zero but shows a slightly skewed distribution with some extreme values (outliers) on both sides. Insight: While most of the residuals are close to zero, the presence of outliers suggests that the model occasionally makes predictions that are significantly off. These outliers might correspond to unusual days in the data (e.g., extreme weather events or special holidays) that the model hasn't fully accounted for. Overall Conclusion: The diagnostic plots indicate that the ARIMA model performs reasonably well, with residuals that are mostly uncorrelated and centered around zero. However, the presence of some autocorrelation and outliers suggests that there could be room for improvement.

# Tunning with SARIMAX

Why: SARIMAX allows for the incorporation of both seasonal components and external regressors. This model is a natural extension of SARIMA, incorporating external factors like weather conditions, which can significantly impact bike rentals.

SARIMAX Model Fit: I've successfully built a SARIMAX model that incorporates seasonality and external regressors.

The model captures the primary patterns in the data, and the residuals suggest that most of the autocorrelation has been accounted for.

Residual Diagnostics: The Ljung-Box test still indicates some autocorrelation in the residuals (p-value < 2.2e-16), suggesting that the model could be further refined. However, the residuals are much closer to behaving like white noise compared to earlier models, and the ACF plot indicates that most of the autocorrelations are within acceptable limits.

Room for Improvement: While there is some remaining autocorrelation, the model has improved significantly. This suggests that while it may not be perfect, it is likely sufficient for practical forecasting purposes.

Future improvements could involve refining the model parameters further, incorporating additional regressors, or exploring non-linear models.

Conclusion:
Statement: "There is still room for improvement, but we can use this model for forecasting."
